title: ECE 422 - Reliable and Secure Systems Design 
description:

---

## Winter 2024

This course covers software system reliability engineering and computer security basics. The goal is to build an understanding of common reliability and security measures in software and hardward systems. Given the fault-proneness of modern software systems, there is a pressing need for programmers and software engineers to grasp reliability issues. Understanding computer system insecurity is also emphasized in the modern web landscape.

## Course content

We will cover both the basics and the latest advancements in reliability and security. Broadly speaking, the topics of this course break into four modules:
- Module 1: Software engineering practices
- Module 2: Reliable and fault-tolerant design
- Module 3: Security principles
- Module 4: Developing areas in reliability and security

Topics include: DevOps, SRE, fault-tolerant design, information redundancy, consensus mechanism, race condition, automated testing, fault localization, authentication, access control, encryption, digital signature, web vulnerabilities, injection, same-origin policy, cross site scripting, and blockchain technologies.

To facilitate the understanding of these topics, we will apply game theory (e.g., Byzantine General problem, Dining philosophers problem). For the pratical portion of this course, you will learn to work in an Agile team and implement emerging reliability and security state-of-the-arts.
