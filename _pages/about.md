I am an Assistant Professor at the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://www.ualberta.ca/engineering/electrical-computer-engineering/index.html) of University of Alberta. Prior joining UoA, I obtained my doctoral degree from Concordia University under the supervision of Dr. [Tse-Hsun (Peter) Chen](https://petertsehsun.github.io/). I have extensive professional experience in various companies and organizations including Huawei Technologies, Bank of Canada, Tianjin University, and McGill University.

My research focuses on software engineering topics that include **software debugging**, **software testing**, **AIOps**, program analysis, and mining software repositories.
