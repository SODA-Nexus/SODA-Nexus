I am an Assistant Professor at the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://www.ualberta.ca/engineering/electrical-computer-engineering/index.html) of University of Alberta. Prior to joining UAlberta, I received my Ph.D. degree from Concordia University and worked as a research assistant at the SPEAR lab under the supervision of Dr. [Tse-Hsun (Peter) Chen](https://petertsehsun.github.io/). I also worked in various companies and organizations, including Bank of Canada, McGill University, Tianjin University and Huawei Technologies over the past eight years.

My research focuses on software engineering topics that include **Software Debugging**, **Software Testing**, **AIOps**, Program Analysis, and Mining Software Repositories.
